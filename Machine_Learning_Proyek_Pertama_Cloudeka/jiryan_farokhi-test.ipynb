       "'airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making . \\nafter all , it\\'s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams . \\neven if most people don\\'t recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few . \\nbut although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! \\nremains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts . \\nin the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high . \\nfilms like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits . \\nthere was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade . \\nand so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . \\nthis time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . \\n . \\n . \\nit had to do with bad fish . \\nairplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . \\nunable to stop living in the past , ted\\'s world fell apart . \\nhe spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) . \\nin a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working . \\nunfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity . \\nin the midst of it all , something happens . \\nsomeone gets sick . \\nthen another . \\nthen another . \\nsoon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people . \\n . \\n . \\nand when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? \\n ( gee , i wonder ) \\nof course the main draw here is the non-stop \" whiz-bang \" comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . \\nalthough i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . \\nthe most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen . \\nhe\\'s a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film . \\nin a film like this , you\\'re not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can\\'t complain about the amateurish quality . \\nwhat you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . \\nthis character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny . \\ni don\\'t know why he was put in there , and i don\\'t think anybody will find a good excuse . \\nand when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old . \\nyou gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long . \\naside from that , airplane ! \\nis really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic . \\nit would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven\\'t seen it . \\nand if they ask what the plot is , just tell \\'em \" it\\'s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that\\'s not important right now . \" \\nif you\\'ve seen the film , you\\'ll understand ; - ) \\n'"
